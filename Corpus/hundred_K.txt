Cryopreservation of reproductive cells and tissues represents an essential aspect of ART practices that might be particularly strategic and helpful during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. However, recommendations on how and when to preserve reproductive tissues and cells during a novel severe pandemic are scanty. This paper uses a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to identify favorable and unfavorable factors and to recognize challenges and obstacles related to the use of cryopreservation procedures during the spreading of a new virus. One of the strengths associated with the cryopreservation is represented by the availability of robust European guidelines on storage safety to prevent sample contamination or cross-contamination by pathogens. These recommendations should be deep-rooted in all ART laboratories. Weaknesses include uncertainties regarding the management of COVID-19 affected asymptomatic patients, the suboptimal accuracy of diagnostic tests for the disease, the nebulous prospective regarding the duration of the pandemic and the additional costs. The application of the strategy represents an opportunity to postpone pregnancy in order to avoid a severe infectious disease during gestation while concomitantly counteracting the possible detrimental effect of time. Critical threats, at present still undefined, are represented by potential adverse events for the mother and offspring due to infected gametes or embryos after thawing and, subsequently, the re-spreading of the virus.
BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and chloroquine treatment for COVID-19 has not been verified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to summarize the clinical practices of non-severe patients with COVID-19 receiving the standard care, LPV/r or chloroquine in Beijing Ditan hospital from January 20 to March 26, 2020. The main outcome measurements include the changes of cycle threshold (Ct) values of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes by RT-PCR assay from day 1 to 7 after admission for patients receiving standard care, or after treatment being initiated for patients receiving either LPV/r or chloroquine. The proportion of developing severe illness, fever duration and the time from symptom onset to chest CT improvement and negative conversion of nucleic acid were compared. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients included in the study, 59 received the standard care, 51 received LPV/r, and 19 received chloroquine. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable among the three groups. The median duration of fever, median time from symptom onset to chest CT improvement and negative conversion of the nucleic acid were similar among the three groups. The median increase in Ct values of N and ORF1ab gene for patients receiving LPV/r or chloroquine or the standard care during the treatment course was 7.0 and 8.5, 8.0 and 7.6, 5.0 and 4.0, respectively. These figures were not found significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Antiviral therapy using LPV/r or chloroquine seemed not to improve the prognosis or shorten the clinical course of COVID-19.
Hybridization has frequently been observed between wild and domestic species and can substantially impact genetic diversity of both counterparts. Geese show some of the highest levels of interspecific hybridization across all bird orders, and two of the goose species in the genus Anser have been domesticated providing an excellent opportunity for a joint study of domestication and hybridization. Until now, knowledge of the details of the goose domestication process has come from archaeological findings and historical writings supplemented with a few studies based on mitochondrial DNA. Here, we used genome-wide markers to make the first genome-based inference of the timing of European goose domestication. We also analyzed the impact of hybridization on the genome-wide genetic variation in current populations of the European domestic goose and its wild progenitor: the graylag goose (Anser anser). Our dataset consisted of 58 wild graylags sampled around Eurasia and 75 domestic geese representing 14 breeds genotyped for 33,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Demographic reconstruction and clustering analysis suggested that divergence between wild and domestic geese around 5,300 generations ago was followed by long-term genetic exchange, and that graylag populations have 3.2-58.0% admixture proportions with domestic geese, with distinct geographic patterns. Surprisingly, many modern European breeds share considerable (> 10%) ancestry with the Chinese domestic geese that is derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoid We show that the domestication process can progress despite continued and pervasive gene flow from the wild form.
Due to the rapid expansion in microbial taxonomy, precise identification of common industrially and agriculturally relevant fungi such as Trichoderma species is challenging. In this study, we introduce the on-line multiloci identification system (MIST) for automated detection of three hundred and forty-nine Trichoderma species based on a set of three DNA barcodes. MIST is based on the reference databases of validated sequences of three commonly used phylogenetic markers collected from public databases. The databases consist of four hundred and sixteen complete sequences of the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS), five hundred and eighty-three sequence fragments of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and five hundred and thirty-four sequence fragments of the gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit 2 (rpb2). Through MIST, information from different DNA barcodes can be combined and the identification of Trichoderma species can be achieved based on the integrated parametric sequence similarity search (blastn) performed in the manner of a decision tree classifier. In the verification process, MIST provided correct identification for forty-four Trichoderma spp. based on DNA barcodes consisting from tef1 and rpb2 markers. Thus, MIST can be used to obtain an automated species identification as well as to retrieve sequences required for the manual identification by means of phylogenetic analysis.IMPORTANCE The genus Trichoderma is important to human kind, with a wide range of applications in industry, agriculture and bioremediation. Thus, quick and accurate identification of Trichoderma species is paramount since it is usually the first step in Trichoderma-based research. However, it frequently becomes a limitation, especially for researchers who lack taxonomic knowledge of fungi. Moreover, as the number of Trichoderma-based studies has increased, a growing number of unidentified sequences have been stored in public databases, which has made the species identification more ambiguous. In this study, we provide an easy to use tool for automated species identification (MIST), a list of Trichoderma species, and corresponding sequences of reference DNA barcodes. Therefore, this study will facilitate the research on the biodiversity and applications of the genus Trichoderma.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious; however, the different routes of transmission are not well understood. Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. This includes corneal transplantation, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in conjunctival swabs of infected patients, and the ocular surface may play an important role in viral entry. Several tissue transplantation organizations have guidelines in place regarding the screening of donors and tissue procurement procedures, including clinical and/or PCR screening of donors. The Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) is currently not recommending asymptomatic PCR screening. However, their antiseptic protocols may play an important role in viral inactivation. SUMMARY: Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low. However, tissue screening guidelines need to be re-evaluated regularly as knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves.
Shock is common in critically ill patients with COVID-19, developing in up to 67% of patients in intensive care (5% to 10% overall) and is associated with high mortality. Optimal management requires prompt recognition with precise evaluation and differentiation. Correcting hypoperfusion and treating the underlying process are fundamental aspects of treatment. Undifferentiated shock may be treated initially with norepinephrine to optimize perfusion while additional evaluation is performed to categorize the shock pathophysiology. Physical examination, bedside echocardiography, hemodynamic monitoring, lactate and venous oxygen saturation are important components of the patient evaluation.
The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been gradually controlled. At present, the management and risk assessment of asymptomatic infected cases has become an urgent problem to be addressed. Asymptomatic case is mainly detected by close contact screening, cluster epidemic investigation, infection source tracking investigation, and active detection of target population. Currently, research on the spread risk from asymptomatic cases was limited, and lacking the data relates to the distribution of asymptomatic cases in large community population. Pathogen detection using PCR is suitable for screening in close contacts of confirmed cases and should be started as early as possible. The antibody test is more suitable for screening in general population where the source of infection is unclear. The management of asymptomatic cases now in China focuses on isolation and medical observation according to the guideline of "early detection, early report, early isolation and early treatment" .
: ACE2 receptor has a broad expression pattern in the cellular membrane and provides a protective action against the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, this enzyme has become of extreme interest during the pandemic infection of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This virus invades alveolar epithelium and cardiomyocytes using ACE2 as a transmembrane receptor. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory peptide that degrades Ang II into Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating the biological effects of the AT1 receptor. The binding between the spike protein of COVID-19 and the enzyme is crucial for the virus to enter the target cells, but whether an increase in ACE2 activity could facilitate the infection is not yet demonstrated. However, this aspect has raised many concerns about the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in infected patients or patients at risk of infection. It appears that cellular infection leads to a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increase in the activity of the Ang II--AT1 axis, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, myocarditis, and hypercoagulability with the possibility of exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome, induction of pulmonary embolism, or appearance of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker drugs should be continued in infected patients, as their discontinuation can increase Ang II activity and induce injury to the lungs or cardiovascular system.
Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) during both the acute pneumonitis stage and the progression into the chronic fibroproliferative phase, leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Currently, there is an unmet clinical and research need for non-invasive approaches to monitor lung inflammation through targeting immunoregulatory pathways contributing to ALI pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the role of targeted imaging of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), as a key integrin mediating the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells to inflamed tissues, in quantifying lung inflammation in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI. Methods: ALI was induced by a single intra-tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (10, 20 or 40 Âµg per mouse) in C57BL/6J mice. Control mice were intra-tracheally instilled with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. VLA-4 targeted PET/CT was performed 24 hours after intravenous injection of a copper-64 (64Cu) labeled high-affinity peptidomimetic ligand, 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-PEG4-LLP2A (64Cu-LLP2A), at day 2 after the induction of ALI. Ex vivo biodistribution of 64Cu-LLP2A was determined by ÃŽÂ³-counting of harvested organs. The severity of lung inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring the expression of inflammatory markers in the lung tissue lysates using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide instillation led to an acute inflammatory response in the lungs, characterized by increased expression of multiple inflammatory markers and infiltration of myeloid cells, along with a significant and specific increase in 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, predominantly in a peribronchial distribution. There was a strong correlation between the lipopolysaccharide dose and 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, as quantified by in vivo PET (R=0.69, P<0.01). Expression levels of both subunits of VLA-4, i.e., integrins &#945;4 and ÃŸ1, significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-1ÃŸ and nitric oxide synthase-2, highlighting the potential of VLA-4 as a surrogate marker of acute lung inflammation. Notably, in vivo 64Cu-LLP2A uptake significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers and VLA-4. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular imaging of VLA-4, as a mechanistically-relevant target in ALI, and the accuracy of VLA-4 targeted PET in quantification of ongoing lung inflammation in a murine model.
BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus called SARS-Cov-2, which shared 82% similarity of genome sequence with SARS-CoV, was found in Wuhan in late December of 2019, causing an epidemic outbreak of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia with dramatically increasing number of cases. Several organs are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported in parts of case-studies reporting characteristics of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed at analyzing the potential route of SARS-Cov-2 entry and mechanism at cellular level. METHOD: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was used to obtain evidence of potential route and ACE2 expressing cell in renal system for underlying pathogenesis of kidney injury caused by COVID-19. The whole process was performed under R with Seurat packages. Canonical marker genes were used to annotate different types of cells. RESULTS: Ten different clusters were identified and ACE2 was mainly expressed in proximal tubule and glomerular parietal epithelial cells. From Gene Ontology (GO) & KEGG enrichment analysis, imbalance of ACE2 expression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, and neutrophil-related processes were the main issue of COVID-19 leading kidney injury. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the cellular evidence that SARS-Cov-2 invaded human kidney tissue via proximal convoluted tubule, proximal tubule, proximal straight tubule cells, and glomerular parietal cells by means of ACE2-related pathway and used their cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming.
Around the world, recommendations for cancer treatment are being adapted in real time in response to the pandemic of COVID-19. We, as a multidisciplinary team, reviewed the standard management options, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system, for hepatocellular carcinoma. We propose treatment recommendations related to COVID-19 for the different stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (ie, 0, A, B, and C), specifically in relation to surgery, locoregional therapies, and systemic therapy. We suggest potential strategies to modify risk during the pandemic and aid multidisciplinary treatment decision making. We also review the multidisciplinary management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as a potentially curable and incurable diagnosis in the setting of COVID-19.
The chemistry of magmas erupted by volcanoes is a message from deep within the Earth's crust, which if decrypted, can provide essential information on magmatic processes occurring at inaccessible depths. While some volcanoes are prone to erupt magmas of a wide compositional variety, others sample rather monotonous chemistries through time. Whether such differences are a consequence of physical filtering or reflect intrinsic properties of different magmatic systems remains unclear. Here we show, using thermal and petrological modelling, that magma flux and the thermal structure of the crust modulate diversity and temporal evolution of magma chemistry in mid to deep crustal reservoirs. Our analysis shows that constant rates of magma input leads to extractable magma compositions that tend to evolve from felsic to more mafic in time. Low magma injection rates into hot or deep crust produces less chemical variability of extractable magma compared to the injection of large batches in colder or shallower crust. Our calculations predict a correlation between magma fluxes and compositional diversity that resembles trends observed in volcanic deposits. Our approach allows retrieval of quantitative information about magma input and the thermal architecture of magmatic systems from the chemical diversity and temporal evolution of volcanic products.
Healthcare employees were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 734 employees, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.6%. Employees with heavy COVID-19 exposure had similar antibody prevalence as those with limited or no exposure. Guidelines for PPE use seem effective for preventing COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the link between human mobility and the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected people in countries. STUDY DESIGN: Our data set covers 144 countries for which complete data are available. To analyze the link between human mobility and COVID-19-infected people, our study focused on the volume of air travel, the number of airports, and the Schengen system. METHODS: To analyze the variation in COVID-19-infected people in countries, we used negative binomial regression analysis. RESULTS: Our findings suggest a positive relationship between higher volume of airline passenger traffic carried in a country and higher numbers of patients with COVID-19. We further found that countries which have a higher number of airports are associated with higher number of COVID-19 cases. Schengen countries, countries which have higher population density, and higher percentage of elderly population are also found to be more likely to have more COVID-19 cases than other countriesCONCLUSIONS Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c at 28 weeks identify women with hyperglycaemia at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes. These opportunistic laboratory tests perform adequately for risk stratification when oral glucose tolerance testing is not available.
SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. The risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age. To identify gene products that may contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with the Gene Ontology (GO) term "blood coagulation" in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and identified four procoagulants, whose expression is higher in males and increases with age (ADAMTS13, F11, HGFAC, KLKB1), and two anticoagulants, whose expression is higher in females and decreases with age (C1QTNF1, SERPINA5). However, the expression of none of these genes was regulated in a proteomics dataset of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and none of the proteins have been identified as a binding partner of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Hence, they may rather generally predispose individuals to thrombosis without directly contributing to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In contrast, the expression of the procoagulant transferrin (not associated to the GO term "blood coagulation") was higher in males, increased with age, and was upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, transferrin warrants further examination in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to COVID-19.
Rice (Oryza sativa) spikelets have a unique inflorescence structure and the mechanisms regulating their development are not yet fully understood. Moreover, approaches to manipulate spikelet development have the potential to increase grain yield. In this study, we identified and characterized a recessive spikelet mutant, namely more floret 1 (mof1). The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs. In addition, the main body of the palea was reduced, and the sterile lemma was enlarged and partially acquired hull (lemma and/or palea) identity. We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect. MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes. Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice.
Drought stress severely restricts crop yield and quality. Small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) play critical roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses by regulating target gene expression, but their roles in drought stress tolerance in apple (Malus domestica) are poorly understood. Here, we identified various snRNAs and their targets from the wild apple species Malus sieversii via high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis. Forty known microRNAs (miRNAs) and eight new snRNAs were differentially expressed in response to 2 or 4 h of drought stress treatment. We experimentally verified the expression patterns of five selected miRNAs and their targets. We established that one miRNA, mdm-miR171i, specifically targeted and degraded SCARECROW-LIKE PROTEINS 26.1 (MsSCL26.1) transcripts. Both knockout of mdm-miR171i and overexpression of MsSCL26.1 improved drought stress tolerance in the cultivated apple line 'GL-3' (M. domestica Borkh.) by regulating the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, especially that of MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (MsMDHAR), which functions in ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism under drought stress. Transient expression analysis demonstrated that MsSCL26.1 activates MsMDHAR transcription by positively regulating the activity of the P1 region in its promoter. Therefore, the miR171i-SCL26.1 module enhances drought stress tolerance in apple by regulating antioxidant gene expression and AsA metabolism.
Instead of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using organic liquid electrolytes, all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSBs) employing solid electrolytes (SEs) are promising for applications in high-energy-density power applications and electric vehicles due to their potential for improving safety and achieving high capacity. Although remarkable progress in SEs has been achieved and has resulted in high ionic conductivity, which now reaches values comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, the typical use of a slurry process for the fabrication of conventional ASSBs inevitably causes harmful reactions between sulfide materials and polar solvents. Here, we studied the efficient infiltration process of SE slurry into conventional composite LIB electrodes (NCM622) for achieving high-energy-density ASSBs via a scalable solution-based fabrication process. Two methods are proposed to ensure that SE materials are evenly distributed and sufficiently infiltrated into the porous structures of LIB electrodes. The LPSCl SE solutions were effectively infiltrated into the electrodes at higher processing temperatures and the temperature was subsequently optimized at above the boiling point of the ethanol solvent due to the dynamic motion of SE molecules via a convective flow during solvent vaporization. Moreover, the porous LIB composite electrodes with a mixture of active materials of different particle sizes formed and filled capillary pores resulting in a high electrode density. The LPSCl SE-infiltrated NCM622 electrodes that used this strategy could remarkably improve the initial discharge capacity of ASSBs to as high as 177 mAh/g. These ASSBs also showed excellent performance even at high loading values (about 17 mg/cm2), making them competitive with LIBs using conventional liquid electrolytes.
PURPOSE We examined whether young people in the U.S. and Canada exhibit similar depressive symptom trajectories in the transition to adulthood and compared the effect of childhood socioeconomic status on trajectory membership. METHODS We used the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child/Young Adult (n = 6,315) and the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n = 3,666). Depressive symptoms were measured using five items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression scale. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 16-25 years were identified using growth mixture models. We estimated the effect of childhood family income, parental education, and parental unemployment on trajectory membership using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variances. RESULTS We identified four similar trajectories in the two countries: (1) low stable; (2) mid-peak; (3) increasing; and (4) decreasing. Relatively more Americans were in the low-stable trajectory group than Canadians (77.6% vs. 64.9%), and fewer Americans were in the decreasing group (7.1% vs. 19.1%). In the U.S., childhood family income in the bottom two quartiles was related to higher rates of increasing trajectory membership compared with income in the top quartile (incidence rate ratios: 1.59-1.79, p < .05), but not in Canada. In the U.S., parental education at a high school level was associated with higher rates of decreasing trajectory membership compared with higher education (incidence rate ratio = 1.45, confidence interval: 1.10-1.91; p = .01), but not in Canada. CONCLUSIONS Depressive symptoms may take a similar course in the transition to adulthood within these two countries. Country differences may modify the degree to which childhood socioeconomic status determines trajectory membership.

The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is native from South America but has become one of the most invasive species in the world. These ants heavily rely on trail pheromones for foraging and previous studies have focused on this signal to develop a strategy of chemical control. Here, we studied the effect of pre-exposure to the trail pheromone on sugar acceptance and olfactory learning in Argentine ants. We used the synthetic trail pheromone component (Z)-9-hexadecenal, which triggers the same attraction and trail following behavior than the natural trail pheromone. We found that pre-exposure to (Z)-9-hexadecenal increases the acceptance of sucrose solutions of different concentrations, thus changing the antÅ› subjective evaluation of a food reward. On the other hand, although ants learned to associate an odor with a sucrose reward, pheromone pre-exposure did neither affect the learning nor the mid-term memory of the odor-reward association. Taking into account the importance of the Argentine ant as a pest and invasive organism, our results highlight the importance of pheromonal cues in resource evaluation, a fact that could be useful in control strategies implemented for this species.
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and life-threatening syndrome classified into primary HLH and secondary HLH. Secondary HLH is always caused by autoimmune disease, infections, or cancer. The first-line therapy for secondary HLH is the HLH 2004 protocol, including dexamethasone, etoposide, and supportive therapy. However, up to 30% of patients, especially pediatric patients, remain unresponsive to first-line treatment, and the mortality rate reaches 50% in children with HLH. Furthermore, some children who have special conditions, such as an active virus infection, are not suitable for immunosuppressants treatment. Recently, several HLH-promoting cytokines have been identified, including interferon-Î³, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 control the signaling of many cytokines, notably interferon-Î³, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, have been successfully used to treat HLH in mice. Here, we report that a boy, diagnosed with HLH and high titer of hepatitis B virus-DNA copies, improved quickly, and the cytokine storm of HLH was alleviated after receiving ruxolitinib. Five days after ruxolitinib treatment, entecavir was introduced and serum titer results of hepatitis B virus-DNA returned negative. With 3 months of ruxolitinib treatment and following-up 1 year, the boy's situation maintained sustained remission. In this study, it is suggested that ruxolitinib might be a first-line drug, which could alleviate the cytokine storm of HLH. This treatment may be ushering in the age of glucocorticosteroid-free HLH treatment, which is particularly meaningful for children because it avoids the side effects of glucocorticosteroid.
Diabetic dyslipidemia (DD), characterized by increased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, is a major factor contributing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cardiovascular risk in type-2 diabetes. Activation of both the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are associated with NASH progression. Here, we tested whether dual-targeting inhibition of hepatic CB1R and iNOS improves DD in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice were treated for 14 days with (S)-MRI-1867, a peripherally-restricted hybrid inhibitor of CB1R and iNOS. (R)-MRI-1867, the CB1R-inactive stereoisomer which retains iNOS inhibitory activity and JD-5037, a peripherally-restricted CB1R antagonist were used to assess the relative contribution of the two targets to the effects of (S)-MRI-1867. (S)-MRI-1867 reduced hepatic steatosis, the rate of hepatic VLDL secretion, upregulated hepatic LDLR expression and reduced the circulating levels of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The decrease in VLDL secretion could be attributed to CB1R blockade while the reduction of PCSK9 levels and the related increase in LDLR resulted from iNOS inhibition via a mTORC1-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, this approach based on the concomitant inhibition of CB1R and iNOS represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia.
CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells generated during ehrlichial infection require CD4+ T cell help and IL-21 signaling for their development, but the exact T cell subset required had not been known. In this study, we show in a mouse model of Ehrlichia muris that type 1 T follicular helper (TFH1) cells provide help to CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells via the dual secretion of IL-21 and IFN-Î³ in a CD40/CD40L-dependent manner. TFH1 cell help was delivered in two phases: IFN-Î³ signals were provided early in infection, whereas CD40/CD40L help was provided late in infection. In contrast to T-bet+ T cells, T-bet+ B cells did not develop in the absence of B cell-intrinsic Bcl-6 but were generated in the absence of T-bet. T-bet-deficient memory B cells were largely indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, although they no longer underwent switching to IgG2c. These data suggest that a primary function of T-bet in B cells during ehrlichial infection is to promote appropriate class switching, not lineage specification. Thus, CD11c+ memory B cells develop normally without T-bet but require Bcl-6 and specialized help from dual cytokine-producing TFH1 cells.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of nephrology integration in the NICU on acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence, provider reporting, and nephrology referral. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study in a single-center NICU from January 2012 to December 2017 (n = 1464). We assessed the impact of clinical practice changes including neonatal-nephrology rounds on the incidence of AKI. RESULTS AKI occurred in 318 neonates (22%). AKI occurred less frequently in those admitted after clinical practice changes (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, clinical practice changes were associated with reduced odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI 0.22-0.44, P < 0.001). Provider reporting of AKI improved (P < 0.001) and more neonates were referred for nephrology follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Increased nephrology integration in the NICU was associated with decreased AKI incidence. While recognition of AKI improved, AKI remained poorly reported and nephrology AKI follow-up did not routinely occur. This study supports the importance of increased nephrology involvement in the NICU.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) and peripheral nerve injuries are traumatic events that greatly impact quality of life. One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone levels that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 days before, and 28 days following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 day recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.Significance Statement There is an urgent need for therapeutics to improve outcomes for patients with neurotrauma. Here we test the effects of a non-invasive diet-based therapy. Ketogenic diets, which are high fat and low carbohydrate-based, have been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, and show promise for treating other neurotrauma and neurodegenerative conditions. Here we show that while we were successful in producing high ketone concentrations in mice, the effects on recovery of function and pain following a thoracic spinal cord hemisection or spared nerve injury were minimal. Therefore, ketogenic diets, while effective in certain cases, should be evaluated depending on the injury type.
Introduction: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is a promising biomarker of pretreatment risk in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Different segmentation methods can be used which predict prognosis equally well but give different optimal cut-offs for risk stratification. Segmentation can be cumbersome meaning a fast, easy and robust method is needed. Aims were to i) evaluate the best automated MTV workflow in DLBCL ii) determine if uptake time, (non)compliance with standardized recommendations for FDG scanning and subsequent disease progression influenced the success of segmentation iii) assess differences in MTV values and discriminatory power of segmentation methods. Methods: 140 baseline FDG-PET/CT scans were selected from UK and Dutch studies in DLBCL to provide a balance between scans at 60- or 90-minutes uptake, parameters compliant or non-compliant with standardized recommendations for scanning and patients with or without progression. An automated tool was used for segmentation using i) standardized uptake value (SUV) 2.5 ii) SUV 4.0 iii) adaptive thresholding [A50P] iv) 41% of maximum SUV [41%] v) majority vote including voxels detected by â‰¥2 methods [MV2] and vi) detected by â‰¥3 methods [MV3]. Two independent observers rated the success of the tool to delineate MTV. Scans that required minimal interaction were rated "success"; scans where > 50% of tumor was missed or required more than 2 editing steps were rated as "failure". Results: 138 scans were evaluable, with significant differences in success and failure ratings between methods. The best performing was SUV4.0, with higher success and lower failure rates than all other methods except MV2 which also performed well. SUV4.0 gave a good approximation of MTV in 105 (76%) scans, with simple editing for a satisfactory result in additionally 20% of cases. MTV was significantly different for all methods between patients with and without progression. SUV41% performed slightly worse with longer uptake times, otherwise scanning conditions and patient outcome did not influence the tool's performance. The discriminative power of methods was similar, but MTV values were significantly greater using SUV4.0 and MV2 than other thresholds except for SUV2.5. Conclusion: SUV4.0 and MV2 are recommended for further evaluation. Automated estimation of MTV is feasible.
Polar van der Waals chalcogenophosphates exhibit unique properties, such as negative electrostriction and multi-well ferrielectricity, and enable combining dielectric and 2D electronic materials. Using low temperature piezoresponse force microscopy, we revealed coexistence of piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric phases in CuInP2Se6, forming unusual domain walls with enhanced piezoelectric response. From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time, phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental size-effects.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Tochen's formula [TF, body weight (kg) plus 6 cm], nasal septum to ear tragus length (NTL) + 1 cm, and Neonatal Resuscitation Program gestational age (NRP-GA) and body weight (NRP-BW)-based intubation table in estimating the oro-tracheal intubation length, and to improve the estimation efficacy using anthropometric measurements in Taiwanese neonates. Study design: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a neonatal intensive care unit in Taipei, Taiwan. One hundred intubated neonates were enrolled. The estimated intubation depth was defined as being mid-tracheal concordant if it placed the endotracheal tip between the upper border of the first and the lower border of the second thoracic vertebra. A linear regression model was used to analyze the relationships between mid-tracheal depth and body weight (BW), NTL and gestational age (GA), and to revise the NRP intubation tables using our results. Results: Overall, 56% of the neonates were born at a GA â‰¤ 28 weeks and 48% had a BW â‰¤ 1,000 g. The overall mid-tracheal concordance rates for TF, NTL + 1 cm, NRP-GA, and NRP-BW estimations were 51.0, 57.0, 15.0, and 14.0%, and in the infants with a BW â‰¤ 1,000 g 56.3, 56.3, 8.3, and 8.3%, respectively. Our revisions of the NRP intubation tables based on the anthropometric measurements of our participants improved the efficacy of BW, GA, and NTL estimations to 63, 44, and 61%, respectively. Conclusion: TF and NTL + 1 cm were more reliable than NRP intubation tables in predicting the neonatal mid-tracheal length in neonates of all BW and GA. Considering morphological differences secondary to ethnicity, we recommend using these tailored recommendations during neonatal resuscitation in Asian neonates.
More and more findings illustrate the critical roles of circular RNA (circRNA) in diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. A major pathological characteristic for DM is the apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) induced by high glucose (HG), however, the function of circRNA in the ECs' phenotypes is still elusive. Here, this study identified an up-regulated circRNA (circVEGFC) in the HG-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Functionally, knockdown of circVEGFC alleviated the apoptosis and recovered the proliferation in HUVECs induced by HG administration. Mechanistically, circVEGFC functioned as the sponge of miR-338-3p, and miR-338-3p was found to target the 3'-Untranslated Regions (3'-UTR) of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1Î±). HIF-1Î±, a critical transcription factor in DM, could activate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and promote its protein product. In conclusion, these findings reveal the promotion of circVEGFC/miR-338-3p/HIF-1Î±/VEGFA axis in the HG-induced ECs' apoptosis, providing a potential treatment strategy for ECs' damage in DM.
Maintaining phosphorus (Pi) homeostasis in nodules is the key to nodule development and nitrogen fixation, an important source of nitrogen for agriculture and ecosystems. PHOSPHATE-TRANSPORTER 1 (PHT1) and its regulator PHOSPHATE-STARVATION-RESPONSE 1 (PHR1), which comprise the PHR1-PHT1 module, play important roles in maintaining Pi homeostasis in different organs. However, the PHR1-PHT1 module and its functions in nodules remain unknown. We identified one PHT1 (GmPHT1;11) and four PHR1 (GmPHR1) homologs in soybean (Glycine max) plants, which displayed specific expression patterns in different tissues in nodules, similar to previously reported GmPHT1;1 and GmPHT1;4. Through the integration of different approaches, GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules were confirmed. Combining our results and previous reports, we established multiple GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules acting in the infected or non-infected tissues in nodules. A single GmPHR had more than one GmPHT1 target, and vice versa. Therefore, overlapping and cross-talking modules monitored the wave of available Pi to maintain Pi homeostasis in nodules, which sequentially regulated nodule initiation and development. High levels of GmPHT1;11 enhanced Pi accumulation in nodules, increased nodule size, but decreased nodule number. Nitrogenase activity was also enhanced by GmPHT1;11. Our findings uncover GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules in nodules, which expand our understanding of the mechanism of maintaining Pi homeostasis in soybean plants.
The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic was announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Government of India declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020 to prevent community transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. Due to the absence of specific antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling plays an important role in better understanding the disease dynamics and in designing strategies to control the rapidly spreading infectious disease. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for four Indian states, namely, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model, including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number R0. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increases, but if the disease transmission rate remains higher, then the endemic equilibrium always remains stable. For the estimated model parameters, R0>1 for all four states, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Short-time prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four states of India.
Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose disease, especially when limited to the jaws. We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with spontaneous jaw pain and a large pre-auricular facial swelling overlying the angle of the mandible that was non-responsive to previous antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment. The diagnosis was confirmed as CNO following evaluation and workup by a multidisciplinary team. The patient exhibited a favourable response to oral alendronate sodium plus vitamin D3 combination treatment. We believe that alendronate sodium is an effective second-line drug for CNO.
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition is now an imperative technique for the diagnosis of multiple diseases in the gastrointestinal tract and nearby structures. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and fine needle biopsy via dedicated FNB needles (EUS-FNB) are two standard-essential tools for tissue acquisition. The choice of needle type is an important factor determining appropriate tissue acquisition. Multiple studies have compared EUS-FNA versus EUS-FNB on different lesions also there are several studies evaluated different needles in terms of sampling adequacy and cytological and histological accuracy. Prior studies comparing prior-generation FNB needles to FNA did not show an increased diagnostic yield with FNB. However, the newer-generation needles have demonstrated enhanced performance compared with their predecessors. As they may provide a large amount of tissue for the cytological and histological evaluation, rapid onsite specimen evaluation (ROSE), and immunohistochemical and molecular analyses, which may be very important for targeted therapy. In this review, we discuss current evidence and literature on the use of the newer generation needles for pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions.
Mechanical-free, high-power, high-beam-quality two-dimensional (2D) beam scanning lasers are in high demand for various applications including sensing systems for smart mobility, object recognition systems, and adaptive illuminations. Here, we propose and demonstrate the concept of dually modulated photonic crystals to realize such lasers, wherein the positions and sizes of the photonic-crystal lattice points are modulated simultaneously. We show using nano-antenna theory that this photonic nanostructure is essential to realize 2D beam scanning lasers with high output power and high beam quality. We also fabricate an on-chip, circuit-driven array of dually modulated photonic-crystal lasers with a 10 Ã— 10 matrix configuration having 100 resolvable points. Our device enables the scanning of laser beams over a wide range of 2D directions in sequence and in parallel, and can be flexibly designed to meet application-specific demands.
Lactobacillus sakei is a non-pathogenic lactic acid bacterium and a natural inhabitant of meat ecosystems. Although red meat is a heme-rich environment, L. sakei does not need iron or heme for growth, while possessing a heme-dependent catalase. Iron incorporation into L. sakei from myoglobin and hemoglobin was formerly shown by microscopy and the L. sakei genome reveals a complete equipment for iron and heme transport. Here, we report the characterization of a five-gene cluster (lsa1836-1840) encoding a putative metal iron ABC transporter. Interestingly, this cluster, together with a heme dependent catalase gene, is also conserved in other species from the meat ecosystem. Our bioinformatic analyses revealed that the locus might refer to a complete machinery of an Energy Coupling Factor (ECF) transport system. We quantified in vitro the intracellular heme in wild-type (WT) and in our Î”lsa1836-1840 deletion mutant using an intracellular heme sensor and ICP-Mass spectrometry for quantifying incorporated 57Fe heme. We showed that in the WT L. sakei, heme accumulation occurs fast and massively in the presence of hemin, while the deletion mutant was impaired in heme uptake; this ability was restored by in trans complementation. Our results establish the main role of the L. sakei Lsa1836-1840 ECF-like system in heme uptake. This research outcome shed new light on other possible functions of ECF-like systems. Importance Lactobacillus sakei is a non-pathogenic bacterial species exhibiting high fitness in heme rich environments such as meat products, although it does not need iron nor heme for growth. Heme capture and utilization capacities are often associated with pathogenic species and are considered as virulence-associated factors in the infected hosts. For these reasons, iron acquisition systems have been deeply studied in such species, while for non-pathogenic bacteria the information is scarce. Genomic data revealed that several putative iron transporters are present in the genome of the lactic acid bacterium L. sakei. In this study, we demonstrate that one of them, is an ECF-like ABC transporter with a functional role in heme transport. Such evidence has not yet been brought for an ECF, therefore our study reveals a new class of heme transport system.
Enterococci are Gram-positive bacteria present in the healthy human microbiota, but they are also a leading cause of nosocomial infections. Maltodextrins utilization by Enterococcus faecalis has been identified as an important factor for colonization of mammalians hosts. Here we show that the LacI/GalR transcriptional regulator MalR, the maltose genes regulator, is also the main regulator of the operons encoding an ABC transporter (mdxEFG) and three metabolic enzymes (mmdH-gmdH-mmgT) required for the uptake and catabolism of maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins. The utilization of maltose and maltodextrins is consequently coordinated and induced by the disaccharide maltose, which binds to MalR. Carbon catabolite repression of the mdxEFG and mmdH-gmdH-mmgT operons is mediated by both, P-Ser-HPr/MalR and P-Ser-HPr/CcpA. The latter complex exerts only moderate catabolite repression which became visible when comparing maltodextrin operon expression in a malR- and a malR-Î”ccpA double mutant grown in the presence of maltose, which is transported via a phosphotransferase system and thus favours the formation of P-Ser-HPr. Moreover, maltodextrin transport via MdxEFG slows rapidly when glucose is added, suggesting an additional regulation via inducer exclusion. This complex regulation of metabolic operons likely allows E. faecalis to fine-tune gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis represents a leading cause of hospital acquired infections worldwide. Several studies highlighted the importance of carbohydrate metabolism in the infection process of this bacterium. The genes required for maltodextrin metabolism are particularly induced during mice infection and therefore should play an important role for pathogenesis. Since no data were hitherto available concerning the regulation of expression of the maltodextrin operons, we have conducted experiments to study the underlying mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE Although the psychological factors of the work environment affect the quality of employees' performance more than physical factors, they have not been broadly explained yet. This study is conducted to explore nurses' perceptions of the co-worker support as psychological resource in the workplace. METHOD The present study is a qualitative research. Fourteen staff nurses who were working in hospitals affiliated to the Khoy University of Medical Sciences, Iran were selected based on purposeful sampling and interviewed using un-structured in-depth interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using conventional content analysis approach through constant comparative method. RESULTS Data analysis revealed four major themes with 11 sub themes. The four major themes include 'emotional support', 'effective working relationship and collaboration', 'suitable social relationships', and 'guidance and teaching'. CONCLUSION The results showed that, nurses had a positive perception of their colleagues' support in the workplace. Co-worker Support is a multidimensional phenomenon and is influenced by various factors. Perceiving support from the colleague and having a sense of support can promote the quality of care and increase dealing with stressful situations in nursing. Therefore, communication and flexibility skills should be taught to both staff and managers in this regard.
We present the case details of seven patients diagnosed with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV, hereafter COVID-19) with hepatic injury. Most of these patients were elderly and had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and other underlying health conditions prior to admission for COVID-19. Liver injury occurred in all seven cases during the course of the disease. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels initially increased (1.2-times to 2.0-times the normal value, respectively) in the second week. The liver function recovered in all patients within one week of conventional liver protection treatment. Elevated serum transaminase levels in these patients were due to the COVID-19 infection but could also be related to systemic immune response caused by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and hepatocyte damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia. COVID-19 is highly infectious and mainly affects the lungs. In some cases, especially in patients with severe disease type, COVID-19 may also cause liver injury. The liver function of patients with severe COVID-19 should be very carefully monitored, especially if the patients are elderly and have underlying comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 2013 nerve conduction study (NCS) reimbursement reduction changed Medicare utilization, payments, and patient access to Medicare physicians, we performed a retrospective analysis of Medicare data (2012-2016 fee-for-service data from the CMS Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File). METHODS: Individual billable services were identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System CPT and G codes. Medicare utilization and payments were stratified by specialty and type of service (electrodiagnostic tests, including NCS and electromyography (EMG), and other neurologic procedures). We also assessed access to Medicare physicians using the annual number of unique beneficiaries receiving initial Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. RESULTS: We identified 676,113 Medicare providers included in all analysis years from 2012-2016 (10,599 neurologists, 5,881 physiatrists, and 659,633 other specialties). Comparing 2016to 2012, 21.1% fewer neurologists, 28.6% fewer physiatrists, and 69.3% fewer other specialists performed NCS and 3.8% fewer neurologists, 21.7% fewer physiatrists, and 5.6% fewer other specialists performed EMG. For NCS providers in 2012, the mean number of unique Medicare beneficiaries increased for neurologists (1.2%) and physiatrists (4.8%) but decreased for other specialists (-6.5%) by 2016. Following the NCS cut, the number of providers performing autonomic and evoked potential testing increased substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The Medicare NCS reimbursement policy resulted in a larger decrease in NCS providers than in EMG providers. Despite fewer neurologists and physiatrists performing NCS, Medicare access to these physicians for E/M services was not affected. Increased autonomic and evoked potential testing may be an unintended consequence of NCS reimbursement change.
Synbiotics are food supplements that combine probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically elicit a health effect in humans. Lactobacillus plantarum exhibits a remarkable genetic and phenotypic diversity, in particular in strain-specific carbohydrate utilization capacities and several strains are marketed as probiotics. We have screened 77 L. plantarum strains for their capacity to utilize specific prebiotic fibers, revealing variable and strain-specific growth efficiencies on isomalto- and galacto-oligosaccharides. We identified a single strain within the screening panel that was able to effectively utilize inulin and FOS, which did not support efficient growth of the rest of the strains. In our panel tested, we did not find strains that could utilize arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides or sulfated fucoidan. The strain-specific growth phenotype on isomalto-oligosaccharides was further analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography and revealed distinct substrate utilization phenotypes within the strain panel. The strain-specific phenotypes could be linked to the strain's genotypes identifying gene clusters encoding for carbohydrate membrane transport systems that are predicted to be involved in the utilization of isomaltose and other (unidentified) oligosaccharides in the isomalto-oligosaccharide substrate.IMPORTANCE Synbiotics combine the concepts of prebiotics and probiotics to synergistically enhance the health benefits associated with these ingredients. Lactobacillus plantarum is encountered as a natural inhabitant of gastrointestinal tract and specific strains are marketed as a probiotic based on their strain-specific health-promoting activities. Strain-specific stimulation of growth through prebiotic substrates could enhance the persistence and/or activity of L. plantarum in situ Our study establishes a high-throughput screening model for prebiotic substrate utilization by individual strains of bacteria, which can be readily employed for synbiotic match-making approaches that aim to enhance the intestinal delivery of probiotics through strain-specific, selective growth stimulation.
BACKGROUND: About ten years ago, an age-related digital divide was identified, where 'the elderly' denoted a group of people at risk of losing the benefits of a digital society. The aims of this work are to find a relationship between self-assessed health and internet use by older people in European countries and to ascertain whether this relationship differs in countries with a more developed eHealth policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ordered logistic regression is estimated for all countries in the sample and for two countries subsets which differ in their eHealth performance. Individual data is collected by SHARE. The classifying criterion of eHealth performance is based on the 'eHealth' policy dimension of the indicator used to construct the Digital Economy and Society Index. The average marginal effects are computed for the variable of internet use. RESULTS: Results show that older people who use the internet tend to report better health status. This relationship however may not hold for low levels of health and it is stronger in countries with low eHealth performance. CONCLUSION: Policy measures on eHealth not only contribute to people's health but also help to alleviate critical situations such as the one created by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Materials with random microstructure are characterized by additional thermodynamic parameters, entropy and temperature of microstructure. It has been argued that there is one more law of thermodynamics: entropy of microstructure decays in isolated systems. In this paper, we check this assertion experimentally for the process of grain growth. We show that entropy of grain structure decays indeed as expected. We study also the equation of state for microstructure entropy. In general, microstructure entropy should be a function of microstructure energy and the average grain size. We observed that the equation of state degenerates, and there is a universal dependence of microstructure entropy on microstructure energy, at least at the stage of self similar grain growth.
A diagnosis of Brugada pattern in pediatric or adolescent patients is rare. COVID-19 is characterized by fevers and a pro-inflammatory state, which may serve as inciting factors for Brugada pattern. Recently described in two adult patients, we report the first case of Brugada pattern in an adolescent with COVID-19.
Electrical manipulation of skyrmions attracts considerable attention for its rich physics and promising applications. To date, such a manipulation is realized mainly via spin-polarized current based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbital torque effect. However, this scheme is energy consuming and may produce massive Joule heating. To reduce energy dissipation and risk of heightened temperatures of skyrmion-based devices, an effective solution is to use electric field instead of current as stimulus. Here, we realize an electric-field manipulation of skyrmions in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectrical heterostructure at room temperature via an inverse magneto-mechanical effect. Intriguingly, such a manipulation is non-volatile and exhibits a multistate feature. Numerical simulations indicate that the electric-field manipulation of skyrmions originates from strain-mediated modification of effective magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our results open a direction for constructing low-energy-dissipation, non-volatile, and multistate skyrmion-based spintronic devices.
BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020, showed that the general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). CONCLUSION: Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers, and patients with mental disorders. Community mental health service systems, online mental health services, telemedicine, and other measures for patients with mental disorders may play a vital role during the pandemic.
Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) immunotherapy for bladder cancer is the only bacterial cancer therapy approved for clinical use. Although presumed to induce T cell-mediated immunity, whether tumor elimination depends on bacteria-specific or tumor-specific immunity is unknown. Herein we show that BCG-induced bladder tumor elimination requires CD4 and CD8 T cells, although augmentation or inhibition of bacterial antigen-specific T cell responses does not alter the efficacy of BCG-induced tumor elimination. In contrast, BCG stimulates long-term tumor-specific immunity that primarily depends on CD4 T cells. We demonstrate that BCG therapy results in enhanced effector function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, mainly through enhanced production of IFN-ÃŽÂ³. Accordingly, BCG-induced tumor elimination and tumor-specific immune memory require tumor cell expression of the IFN-ÃŽÂ³ receptor, but not MHC class II. Our findings establish that a bacterial immunotherapy for cancer is capable of inducing tumor immunity, an antitumor effect that results from enhanced function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, and ultimately requires tumor-intrinsic IFN-ÃŽÂ³ signaling, via a mechanism that is distinct from other tumor immunotherapies.
99mTc-PHC-102 is a 99mTc-labeled derivative of acetazolamide, a high-affinity small organic ligand of Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX). 99mTc-PHC-102 has previously shown favourable in vivo biodistribution properties in mouse models of CAIX-positive clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and colorectal cancer. In this study, we aimed to explore the targeting performance of 99mTc-PHC-102 in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with RCC, while also assessing the safety and tolerability of the radiotracer. Methods: We studied five patients with localized or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in a microdosing regimen, after the administration of 100 Âµg total CAIX ligand and 600-800 MBq 99mTc-PHC-102. Tissue distribution and residence time in normal organs and tumors were analysed by serial SPECT/CT scans at three time points (30 minutes, 2, and 6 hours) after intravenous administration. Results: In the five patients studied, 99mTc-PHC-102 was well tolerated and no study drug-related adverse events were recorded. The radiotracer showed a rapid initial uptake in the stomach, kidneys and gallbladder, which cleared over time. Localization of the study drug in primary tumors of five patients was observed with favourable tumour-to-background ratios. 99mTc-PHC-102-SPECT/CT allowed the identification of four previously unknown lung and lymph node metastases in two patients. Conclusion: 99mTc-PHC-102 is a promising SPECT tracer for the imaging of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This tracer has the potential to identify primary and metastatic lesions in different anatomical locations. 99mTc-PHC-102 might also serve as companion diagnostic agent for future CAIX-targeting therapeutics.
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) demonstrates lower conspicuity on 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET than the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Other molecular imaging methods may be needed for evaluation of this malignancy. As ILC is nearly always (95%) estrogen receptor (ER) positive, ER-targeting PET tracers such as 16&#945;-[18F]-fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) may have value. We reviewed prospective trials at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT to evaluate metastatic ILC patients with synchronous [18F]FDG and [18F]FES PET/CT imaging, which allowed a head-to-head comparison of these two PET tracers. Methods: Six prospective clinical trials utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT in patients with metastatic breast cancer were performed at MSK from 2008-2019. These trials included 92 patients, of which 14 (15%) were of ILC histology. Seven of 14 patients with ILC had an [18F]FDG PET/CT performed within 5 weeks of the research [18F]FES PET/CT and no intervening change in management. For these 7 patients, the [18F]FES and [18F]FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed to determine the total number of tracer avid lesions, organ systems of involvement, and SUVmax of each organ system for both tracers. Results: In the seven comparable pairs of scans, there were a total of 254 [18F]FES-avid lesions (SUVmax 2.6 to 17.9) and 111 [18F]FDG-avid lesions (SUVmax 3.3 to 9.9) suspicious for malignancy. For 5 of 7 (71%) of ILC patients, [18F]FES PET/CT detected more metastatic lesions than [18F]FDG PET/CT. In the same 5 of 7 patients, the SUVmax of [18F]FES-avid lesions was greater than the SUVmax of [18F]FDG-avid lesions. One patient had [18F]FES avid metastases with no corresponding [18F]FDG avid metastases. There were no patients with [18F]FDG avid distant metastases without [18F]FES avid distant metastases, although in one patient liver metastases were evident on [18F]FDG but not [18F]FES PET. Conclusion: [18F]FES PET/CT compared favorably with [18F]FDG PET/CT for detection of metastases in patients with metastatic ILC. Larger prospective trials of [18F]FES PET/CT in ILC should be considered to evaluate ER-targeted imaging for clinical value in patients with this histology of breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), to be a pandemic. From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on GoogleÂ® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term risk of first cardiovascular (CV) events, CV deaths and all-cause deaths in community-dwelling participants of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programme delivered in a primary care setting. METHODS: Individuals who visited a primary healthcare service in Sollentuna (Sweden) and agreed to participate in the programme between 1988 and 1993 were followed. They had at least one CV risk factor but no prior myocardial infarction and received support to increase physical activity using the programme Physical Activity on Prescription and to adopt health-promoting behaviours including cooking classes, weight reduction, smoking cessation and stress management. Participants (n=5761) were compared with a randomly selected, propensity score-matched reference group from the general population in Stockholm County (n=34 556). All individuals were followed in Swedish registers until December 2011. RESULTS: In the intervention group and the reference group there were 698 (12.1%) and 4647 (13.4%) first CV events, 308 (5.3%) and 2261 (6.5%) CV deaths, and 919 (16.5%) and 6405 (18.5%) all-cause deaths, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 22 years. The HR (95% CI) in the intervention group compared with the reference group was 0.88 (0.81 to 0.95) for first CV events, 0.79 (0.70 to 0.89) for CV deaths and 0.83 (0.78 to 0.89) for all-cause deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a CVD prevention programme in primary healthcare focusing on promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyle was associated with lower risk of CV events (12%), CV deaths (21%) and all-cause deaths (17%) after two decades. Promoting physical activity and healthy living in the primary healthcare setting may prevent CVD.
The pandemic threat of COVID-19 causes serious concern for people and world organizations. The effect of Coronavirus disease on the lifestyle and economic status of humans is undeniable, and all of the researchers (biologists, pharmacists, physicians, and chemists) can help decrease its destructive effects. The molecular docking approach can provide a fast prediction of the positive influence the targets on the COVID-19 outbreak. In this work, we choose resveratrol (RV) derivatives (22 cases) and two newly released coordinate structures for COVID-19 as receptors [Papain-like Protease of SARS CoV-2 (PBD ID: 6W9C) and 2019-nCoV RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (PBD ID: 6M71)]. The results show that conformational isomerism is significant and useful parameter for docking results. A wide spectrum of interactions such as Van der Waals, conventional hydrogen bond, Pi-donor hydrogen bond, Pi-Cation, Pi-sigma, Pi-Pi stacked, Amide-Pi stacked and Pi-Alkyl is detected via docking of RV derivatives and COVID-19 receptors. The potential inhibition effect of RV-13 (-184.99 kj/mol), and RV-12 (-173.76 kj/mol) is achieved at maximum value for 6W9C and 6M71, respectively.
Because SARS-CoV-2 spreads easily and healthcare workers are at increased risk of both acquiring and transmitting infection, all healthcare facilities must rapidly and rigorously implement the full hierarchy of established infection controls: source control (removal or mitigation of infection sources), engineering and environmental controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment.
OBJECTIVE: To describe user-centered voting systems that would support the safe conduct of voting in a pandemic environment. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated our democratic processes. Voters and poll workers feel threatened by the potential dangers of voting in business-as-usual polling stations. Indeed, significant problems were encountered in the recent 2020 primary elections in Wisconsin, where the National Guard had to be mobilized because so few poll workers reported to work, and more than 90% of polling places had to remain closed. METHOD: We describe a number of possible user-centered solutions that would help protect voters and poll workers in times of pandemic, and also report the results of a survey that asked voters and poll workers about what kinds of systems might make them willing to vote. RESULTS: Political as well as safety considerations will need to be considered as these safer voting solutions are designed since, surprisingly, the kinds of solutions preferred depend on the political affiliation of the voters. CONCLUSION: Human factors professionals have a large role to play in realizing the safe, successful implementation of these user-centered systems. Good human factors analysis can help minimize the risk to voters and poll workers. Moreover, human factors methods can help safeguard democracy by creating safe and well-engineered environments that are conducive to voting in the age of pandemics. APPLICATION: Creating safe and effective voting solutions that protect voters and poll workers during pandemic outbreaks is crucial to the preservation of democracy.
The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is native from South America but has become one of the most invasive species in the world. These ants heavily rely on trail pheromones for foraging and previous studies have focused on this signal to develop a strategy of chemical control. Here, we studied the effect of pre-exposure to the trail pheromone on sugar acceptance and olfactory learning in Argentine ants. We used the synthetic trail pheromone component (Z)-9-hexadecenal, which triggers the same attraction and trail following behavior than the natural trail pheromone. We found that pre-exposure to (Z)-9-hexadecenal increases the acceptance of sucrose solutions of different concentrations, thus changing the ants subjective evaluation of a food reward. On the other hand, although ants learned to associate an odor with a sucrose reward, pheromone pre-exposure did neither affect the learning nor the mid-term memory of the odor-reward association. Taking into account the importance of the Argentine ant as a pest and invasive organism, our results highlight the importance of pheromonal cues in resource evaluation, a fact that could be useful in control strategies implemented for this species.
AIM: To describe the effect of the stringent lockdown measures, introduced in the UK on 23 March 2020 to curtail the transmission of COVID-19, on glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. METHODS: We undertook an observational study of 572 individuals with type 1 diabetes for whom paired flash glucose monitoring data were available between early March and May 2020. The primary outcome was change in flash glucose monitoring variables. We also assessed clinical variables associated with change in glycaemic control. RESULTS: Percentage of time in range increased between March and May 2020 [median (interquartile range) 53 (41-64)% vs 56 (45-68)%; P < 0.001], with associated improvements in standard deviation of glucose (P <0.001) and estimated HbA1c (P <0.001). There was a small reduction in the number of individuals meeting the hypoglycaemia target of <5% per day (64% vs 58%; P = 0.004). Comparing changes in flash glucose monitoring data from March to May in 2019 with the same period in 2020 confirmed that these differences were confined to 2020. Socio-economic deprivation was an independent predictor of a &#8805;5% reduction in time in range during lockdown (odds ratio 0.45 for people in the two most affluent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles; P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was not associated with a significant deterioration in glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. However, socio-economic deprivation appeared to increase the risk of decline in glycaemic control, which has implications for how support is focused in challenging times.
BACKGROUND: Pain is common yet under-studied among older Medicare home health (HH) patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). AIMS: Examine (1) the association between ADRD and severe pain in Medicare HH patients; and (2) the impact of severe pain and ADRD on unplanned facility admissions in this population. DESIGN: Analysis of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Medicare claims data. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: 6,153 patients &#8805;65 years receiving care from a nonprofit HH agency in 2017. METHODS: Study outcomes included presence of severe pain and time-to-event measures of unplanned facility admissions (hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation facilities). ADRD was identified using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and cognitive impairment symptoms. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine, respectively, the association between ADRD and severe pain, and the independent and interaction effects of severe pain and ADRD on unplanned facility admission. RESULTS: Patients with ADRD (n = 1,525, 24.8%) were less likely to have recorded severe pain than others (16.4% vs. 23.6%, p < .001). Adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, mental and physical functional status, and use of HH services, having severe pain was related to a 35% increase (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35, p = .002) in the risk of unplanned facility admission, but the increase in such risk was the same whether or not the patient had ADRD. CONCLUSIONS: HH patients with ADRD may have under-recognized pain. Severe pain is a significant independent predictor of unplanned facility admissions among HH patients.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In this moments, of extreme gravity in which we find ourselves, and in the uncertainty face about the most effective treatment against COVID-19 disease and with the aim of find the evidence that support the chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine use recommendation to treat COVID-19 disease, a systematic review of published studies and RCT studies publishes until April 28, 2020 was carried out. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed with the keywords COVID-19 and their synonyms and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. The data selection and extraction was elaborated by two researchers, independently. The results were discussed with a Primary Care physicians clinical group and the results were synthesized using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: A good quality systematic review was found that includes articles with a high risk of bias. And 8 EC launched that will produce results beyond May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conclusions of the systematic review generate a low confidence in the results, and the clinical variables that show benefit are intermediate variables, the side effects are acceptable and could be minimized with the use of QT lengthening risk tools, so it is could make a weak recommendation in favor of the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild-moderate stage COVID-19.
There are currently limited data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and optimal management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy recipients. Given the experience with other respiratory viruses, we anticipate that patients may develop severe clinical disease and thus provide the following general principles for cancer centers across the nation. These guidelines were developed by members of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Infectious Diseases Special Interest Group. Specific practices may vary depending on local epidemiology and testing capacity, and the guidance provided in this document may change as new information becomes available.
INTRODUCTION: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has become a global healthcare challenge due to increases in its incidence and mortality rates. Faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is postulated as a protocol to prevent CDI recurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A donor faecal sample and patient faecal samples (pre-FMT and post-FMT) were analysed. The r16S gene was amplified and sequenced by NGS, and its diversity and taxonomy composition were examined. RESULTS: Microbial richness increased in post-FMT samples, and the ÃŸ diversity studies grouped the samples into two clusters. One included the non-pathological samples (donor and pre-FMT samples), and the other included the pathological sample. The results obtained by Qiime2 and Bioconductor were similar. CONCLUSION: The analysis showed an increase in taxonomic diversity after the FMT, which suggests its usefulness. Moreover, these results showed that standardisation of bioinformatics analysis is key.
The implementation effect of the 24-hour Supervise-Correct-Improve (SCI) supervision model was investigated in COVID-19 isolation ward in putting on and taking off process of personal protective equipment. As shown in results, the error rate of taking off process was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) by applying the 24h "SCI" mode. Staffs over 40 years old and workers were more likely to make mistakes. Through uninterrupted supervision and protection, application of this mode is proved to be effective.
OBJECTIVE: To examine dietary behaviors and diet quality among caregivers of children regarding the number of policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) change interventions implemented in their neighborhoods. METHODS: Households with incomes &#8804;185% of the federal poverty level were randomly sampled throughout California. A validated 24-h dietary recall assessment tool was administered by telephone. The independent variable was the number of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education PSE change interventions per census tract where the caregivers lived. RESULTS: Most (69.1%) of the 2,222 caregivers were Latino. Policy, systems, and environmental reach predicted decreased intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (PÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯.022, Cohen dÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯-.12) and added sugar (PÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯.014, Cohen dÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯-.18), and increased Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores (PÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯.046, Cohen dÃ¢Â€Â¯=Ã¢Â€Â¯.18), regardless of race and/or ethnicity, age, or reach of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education direct education. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Replication of these methods and findings, and comparisons of dietary outcomes in association with PSE change interventions with and without direct education activities aimed at the same population under study, are encouraged.
The self-powered sensors are more and more important in current society. However, detecting both light and temperature signals simultaneously without energy waste and signal interference is still a challenge. Here, we report a ZnO/graphene nanocomposite foam-based self-powered sensor, which can realize the simultaneous detection of light and temperature by using the conjuncted photo-thermoelectric effect in ZnO-graphene nanocomposite foam sensor. The output current under light
INTRODUCTION: The health emergency caused by the spread of SARS-COV-2 virus has required the adoption of passive measures against contagion, such as social distancing. The use of filtering masks, of the different types available on the market, such as surgical and facial filtering masks (FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3), is also recommended. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper, within the Italian and European regulatory reference framework, is to suggest a rational application of existing methodologies that enable to know and assess the features and/or make a face mask intended to be used by the community. In addition to this, the study aims to provide a correct regulatory framework and useful information for a correct use and disposal of face masks. Another purpose is the assessment of the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. METHODS: The analysis of filtering masks is based on the review of scientific literature, the state of art of technology and the filtering means/materials available. Reference is made to filtering mechanisms and devices, the testing methods, the technical, manufacturing and performance features, and to the Italian and European regulatory reference framework. Reference is also made to the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. RESULTS: Surgical masks or, alternatively, filtering masks with a filtration efficiency between 90% and 95% for 3-Âµm particles, are the most practicable choice with minor contraindications. The reusable type of mask is conceptually superior compared to single-use masks, but cleaning procedures to be followed are quite complex and not always described in a clear way. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of rigorous and repeatable tests on mask filtration capacity, breathability, wearability, duration of use, regeneration, as well as safe disposal methods, are the main way to provide users with correct selection and use criteria. The results must be disclosed and disseminated quickly.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the clinicopathologic features of 105 new cases of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) from Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, and South Africa. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and radiographic data were collected from records of 5 oral pathology laboratories, and all cases were microscopically reviewed. RESULTS: This series of cases included 36 (34.2%) from South Africa; 33 (31.4%) from Brazil; 23 (21.9%) from Mexico; and 13 (12.3%) from Guatemala. Seventy-two patients (68.5%) were females and 33 patients (31.4%) were males, with an average age of 19.2 years. The tumors predominantly affected the anterior maxilla (48.5%), followed by the anterior mandible (29.5%); posterior mandible (15.2%); and posterior maxilla (6.6%). Sixty-three tumors (63.6%) were follicular, 34 (34.3%) were extrafollicular, and 2 (2%) were peripheral. In most cases, the tumors caused considerable cortical expansion (average size 3.4 cm). Microscopically, most cases showed rosette-like and duct-like structures. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest case series of AOTs reported in the literature and the first multicenter study involving populations from Latin America and South Africa. In a fifth of the present cases, the posterior regions of the gnathic bones were affected and the tumors demonstrated larger sizes compared with cases occurring in other populations.
INTRODUCTION: This study sought to analyse differences in epidemiology and survival between women and men living with HIV in the CoRIS cohort and the course of their disease over a 10-year period. METHODS: Variables of interest between women living with HIV and men living with HIV were compared. A trend analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox regression analysis were used to study survival. RESULTS: A total of 10,469 people were enrolled; of them, 1,742 (16.6%) were women. At the time of enrolment in the cohort, women living with HIV, compared to men living with HIV, had higher rates of transmission due to intravenous drug use (IDU), hepatitisC virus (HCV) coinfection, AIDS-stage disease and foreign origin. They also had a worse immunovirological status and a lower educational level. These differences were maintained in the trend study. Regarding age, the women included in the cohort were older whereas the men were younger. In the comparative analysis between women according to place of origin, we found that the group of Spanish women living with HIV featured older women with higher rates of IDU transmission and HCV coinfection, whereas the group of women living with HIV born outside of Spain featured women with higher rates of syphilis infection. There were no major differences in relation to other characteristics such as educational level or disease status. Although sex was not a determinant of survival, conditions more prevalent in women were determinants of survival. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected women presented at diagnosis with certain epidemiological and HIV-associated characteristics that made them more vulnerable. These trends became more marked or did not improve during the years of observation.
BACKGROUND: Clot density (Hounsfield units, HU) and perviousness (post-contrast increase in the HU of clot) are thought to be associated with clot composition. We evaluate whether these imaging characteristics were associated with angiographic outcomes of aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy in COMPASS: a trial of aspiration thrombectomy versus stent retriever thrombectomy as first-line approach for large vessel occlusion. METHODS: Clot density and perviousness were measured by two independent operators who were blind to all the final angiographic and clinical outcomes. The association of clot density and perviousness with the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale after first pass was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Among all patients enrolled in COMPASS, 165 were eligible for the post-hoc analysis (81 patients in the aspiration first and 84 in the stent retriever first groups). Overall mean perviousness of clot was significantly higher in patient with mTICI 2b-3 after first pass (28.6Â±22.9 vs 20.3Â±19.2, p=0.017). Mean perviousness among patients who achieved TICI 2c/3 versus TICI 2b versus TICI 0-2a in the aspiration first group varied significantly (32.6Â±26.1, 35.3Â±24.4, and 17.7Â±13.1, p=0.013). The association of perviousness with first pass success was not significant in the stent retriever group. Using multivariate analysis, high perviousness (defined as cut-off >27.6) was an independent predictor of TICI 2b-3 (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.10 to 13.19; p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Clot perviousness is associated with first pass angiographic success in patients treated with the aspiration first approach for thrombectomy.
INTRODUCTION The laparoscopic repair of a rare diaphragmatic Morgagni hernia using the reduced port approach is described. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 85-year-old female presented with a 2 days history of upper abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite. We diagnosed her condition as a Morgagni hernia by morphological studies and performed laparoscopic mesh placement with a multi-channel port and 12-mm port. This elderly patient had a rapid postoperative recovery. A 2-year follow-up CT showed no recurrence of the hernia. DISCUSSION Recent trends in laparoscopic procedures have been toward minimizing the number of incisions to reduce invasiveness. This case indicated that the reduced port approach can be considered a suitable and safe procedure for treatment of Morgagni hernia. CONCLUSION The reduced port approach is a good indication for Morgagni hernia.
AIM A prospective study to assess the clinical application of extracorporeal "Giant" locking sliding knot (GLSK) in pediatric and neonatal minimally invasive surgery (MIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 152 MIS, of various complexities were performed over a 14-month period with more than 1100 GLSKs used in 126 procedures. RESULTS There were no major complications or deaths in this cohort. Unraveling of the GLSK was observed in three instances (0.3%) secondary to excessive manipulation. Only a copolymer of glycolic acid/trimethylene carbonate material (Maxon suture; Covidien, Norwalk, CT) and polyproplene (Prolene suture; Ethicon, Sommerville, NJ) can be used for the GLSK technique due to their very smooth surface. CONCLUSION Extracorporeal GLSKs can replace intracorporeal knots because they are safe, faster to tie, and reduce the surgeon's fatigue during complex MIS.
Given the growing scale and complexity of responses to humanitarian crises, it is important to develop a stronger evidence base for health interventions in such contexts. Humanitarian crises present unique challenges to rigorous and effective research, but there are substantial opportunities for scientific advance. Studies need to focus where the translation of evidence from noncrisis scenarios is not viable and on ethical ways of determining what happens in the absence of an intervention. Robust methodologies suited to crisis settings have to be developed and used to assess interventions with potential for delivery at scale. Strengthening research capacity in the low- to middle-income countries that are vulnerable to crises is also crucial.
The past decade has seen remarkable technical advances in infectious disease diagnosis, and the pace of innovation is likely to continue. Many of these techniques are well suited to pathogen identification directly from pathologic or clinical samples, which is the focus of this review. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing are now routinely performed on frozen or fixed tissues for diagnosis of bacterial infections of animals. These assays are most useful for pathogens that are difficult to culture or identify phenotypically, when propagation poses a biosafety hazard, or when suitable fresh tissue is not available. Multiplex PCR assays, DNA microarrays, in situ hybridization, massive parallel DNA sequencing, microbiome profiling, molecular typing of pathogens, identification of antimicrobial resistance genes, and mass spectrometry are additional emerging technologies for the diagnosis of bacterial infections from pathologic and clinical samples in animals. These technical advances come, however, with 2 caveats. First, in the age of molecular diagnosis, quality control has become more important than ever to identify and control for the presence of inhibitors, cross-contamination, inadequate templates from diagnostic specimens, and other causes of erroneous microbial identifications. Second, the attraction of these technologic advances can obscure the reality that medical diagnoses cannot be made on the basis of molecular testing alone but instead through integrated consideration of clinical, pathologic, and laboratory findings. Proper validation of the method is required. It is critical that veterinary diagnosticians understand not only the value but also the limitations of these technical advances for routine diagnosis of infectious disease.
Non-adherence to multipharmacological treatment increases the risk of morbidity, mortality and hospitalization. We know little about the perspective of patients with chronic kidney disease regarding factors influencing medicine taking. This study aimed to synthesize findings from qualitative studies of patients' experiences of factors that facilitate and hinder adherence to medication. A systematic review of qualitative studies adhering to the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) framework. Systematic searches were conducted in several databases. We used thematic synthesis and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) approach to assess the confidence of the evidence. Nineteen studies involving 381 patients with chronic kidney disease were included. We identified three analytical themes; logistics, benchmarking the need for medication; and the quality of the patient-physician relationship, with seven descriptive sub-themes as factors influencing patients' adherence to medications. Helping patients to map their everyday activities and motivating them to associate medications with everyday activities may facilitate adherence to medications. Addressing patient beliefs about medications, supporting patients in coping with side effects of medications and eliciting patients' wishes for involvement in treatment decisions may also facilitate adherence. Barriers to adherence were the costs of buying medications, and lacking understanding of the indications and effects of medications. The findings in this synthesis resonate with previous research and extend the known literature by synthesizing and formally assessing confidence in the evidence.
